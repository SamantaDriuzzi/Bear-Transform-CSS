# ANIMATION BEAR

## Introduction:

This is my first transformation with CSS.

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course. The program proposes to transform HTML elements to create attractive layouts, use transformations to rotate elements, scale them, and more.

In this project I used CSS transforms to position and size parts of a penguin, create a background, and animate it.

Finally, with the knowledge obtained I decided to create a bear in a mountainous environment and apply animation to it.
